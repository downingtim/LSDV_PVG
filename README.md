This is the code and data repository for the lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) pangenome variation graph (PVG).

The foler 121_SAMPLE_PVG contains data for the PVG created from all available valid LSDV genomes (n=121).

The foler 6_SAMPLE_PVG contains data for the PVG created from 6 representative LSDV genomes for computationally efficient investigation.
